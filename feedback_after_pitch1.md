# TODO
## Features
* use features of specific frames (to get time relevant features?)
* Fourier (if have time enough)
* Add more features

## Normalisation
* try other normalisation technique (maybe normalize over sample instead of frame only)

## Augumentation
* implement leave x frame out
* interpolation? 
* fix mirror augumentation (swap R with L) **URGENT**
* principle side analysis instead of mirroring

## Splitting
* make folds stratified or make sure that each label is in each fold **URGENT**

## PCA
* nice visualisation of features with PCA
* try out LD (supervised)
