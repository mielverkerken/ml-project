Glossary:
d is the euclidean distance
dx is just the plain difference in x coordinate (no abs)
dy is just the plain difference in y coordinate (no abs)
c is the baricenter
mean(c) is the mean of the baricenter in all the frames
sctl= second to last point of the finger (more reliable than last point)

Features calculated on frames:
-dy(c(shoulders), wrist)
-d(c(head), c(hands))
-d( sctl(thumb), mean(c(chin)))
-d( sctl(index), mean(c(mouth)))
-d(sctl(thumb), sctl(pink))
-var(hands_x)
-var(hands_y)
Repeat above for both hands
-dx(wrists)
-d(sctl(indexes)
