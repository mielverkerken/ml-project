# TODO Phase 2
## Linear models
- [ ] logistic regression
- [ ] svm
- [ ] random forest?
- [ ] lda
- [ ] naive bayes
- [ ] knn

## pipeline
chain together
- data split
- preprocessing
- feature expansian
- hyper-tuning
- feature selection
- different models

## feature analysis
- see which features are relevent
- look at samples we missclassify and how to improve these
